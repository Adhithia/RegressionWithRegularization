# RegressionWithRegularization
Multiple Linear Regression performed along with Regularization techniques involving Ridge and Lasso.

**Surprise Housing Case Study**

_Problem Statement:_
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
The company wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
How well those variables describe the price of a house.

This problem statement will be attempted using Multiple Linear Regression Techniques along with Regularization involving Ridge and Lasso Regression.
Also EDA and other statistical analysis will be performed on the data.
